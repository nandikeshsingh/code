// Hi Pravartya, my experience has been great so far and as far as work culture is concerned it is currently in hybrid mode and I myself rarely go to office like working from home mostly as of now so won't be able to tell you much on that but in general the team and the managers are really good and the work load is also around low to moderate in my team.
