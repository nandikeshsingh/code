1.Convert long long to int to improve speed.
2.For Dijkstra(n=1e5),Flyod warshall(n=500),Bellman Ford(n=5000) look
at the constraint to identify the algorithm.
3.DP on graph only work on DAG.
4.When doing some query question it's better to save the query value in case we get the same query again (dp basically).
5.Remember all the forms of dp.
6.For implementing principle of inclusion and exclusion iterate over all the mask of the given set(depends on the question) and add 
subtract according to the signs obtained(this also depends on the question).
7.A number has an odd number of divisors only if it is a perfect square.
